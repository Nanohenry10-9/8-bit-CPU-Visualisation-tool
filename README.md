# CPU-visualisation-tool
Tool for visualising and teaching the inner workings of a simple 8-bit processor.

To run this, you need to install [Processing 3](http://processing.org), make sure the `cpu_visualisation` contains a `data` folder and a `cpu_visualisation.pde` file and then run the code from the Processing IDE.
