# CPU-visualisation-tool
Tool for visualising and teaching the inner workings of a simple 8-bit processor.

To run this, you need to install [Processing 3](http://processing.org), make sure the `cpu_visualisation` directory contains the `data` directory and the `cpu_visualisation.pde` file and then run the `.pde` file from the Processing IDE.

The GUI is a 3D cube, that can be turned with the arrow keys.

## Windows executable
At this moment, there is no standalone executable, so it has to be run from the Processing IDE (which is compatible with most platforms though!)
